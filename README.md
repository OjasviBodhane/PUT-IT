# PUT-IT
This project focuses on developing a modern online auction platform using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, offering a seamless and real-time auction experience. The platform will allow sellers to list products and buyers to place bids, all while providing secure payments, user-friendly interfaces, and scalable performance.
